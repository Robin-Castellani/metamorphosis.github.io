# Hello world ðŸ—º

*As time passes by, we change and evolve to something new.*

I decided to follow my dream. At least, the dream I'm dreaming on now.
That is: travel and live in a warm place, where people are easy.

My short/medium-term strategy is creating a small blog along with a 
customized portfolio. I'll have to learn a lot; I hope this little
corner of the web will become useful to me and for those who are 
looking for the IT-part of myself.

I'm pretty sure I'll have some hardcore fun while getting this project done ðŸ˜Ž

Also, ðŸ’œlich willkommen!
