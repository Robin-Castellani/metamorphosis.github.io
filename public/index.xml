      <description>This is a story into which you could find a bit of yourself, a story about a dream which turned into a different reality. Just let yourself enjoy the telling and dream your dream‚Ä¶ üòâ&#xA;It‚Äôs the roaring late 2000s. You‚Äôre a teenager, your parents give you an iMac because they think you could get fun out of it - and tinker with what they think is a cool tech platform.</description>

      <description>As time passes by, we change and evolve to something new.&#xA;I decided to follow my dream. At least, the dream I‚Äôm dreaming on now. That is: travel and live in a warm place, where people are easy.&#xA;My short/medium-term strategy is creating a small blog along with a customized portfolio. I‚Äôll have to learn a lot; I hope this little corner of the web will become useful to me and for those who are looking for the IT-part of myself.</description>
