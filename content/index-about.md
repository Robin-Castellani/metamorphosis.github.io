# 🦎 I'm not a lizard...
... but I love the sun ☀️ and coding 👨‍💻

## I'm Robin and this is my little place in the metaweb!

Here you'll find something about me and what I like to do with the code. 

Now living in *Bel Paese* (aka Italy), I dream to know more inspiring people, to travel and, who knows, to inspire someone.

Among my interests you'll find anthropology, nature and climate change.
