When at work, everyone wants to use the best tools. Me too. This is my journey to the discover of the fabulous keyboard I use 🌝

I work daily with the PC both for work and for personal enjoyment. I spend *a lot* of time typing. To me, the built-in laptop keyboard was ok; I knew no other kind of keyboards, until...

...in 2021, my former colleague Claudio told me 
> I prefer using the full-size keyboard to prevent wrist pain as I pass my whole day at the PC

Boom 🤯 This comment triggered in me the curiosity to find ergonomic keyboard. As Claudio, the keyboard was one of the main tools for my work. 

When you work all day long using an instrument, that instrument
- ☝️ must be effective 
- ✌️ it must cause no harm in the short as well as in the long term

Do you agree?

I tought that I was effective with my laptop keyboard.

I had a look at my wrists when typing and they were *not* in a pleasant position. They were crooked. 

I realized it: the laptop keyboard was *not* ergonomic.

😖 To me, it's been a ground-breaking consciousness: what I was using 10 hours a day didn't fit my value of staying healthy.

Searching here and there, I stumbled upon split keyboards. What's a split keyboard?

Basically, you take your keyboard and you split it in two halves.

Uoaaaaaa 💥

This let your shoulder wider and your wrists straight.

The best isn't finished yet: try tilt outward the two halves.

Now, you feel comfortable 😌

🗺️ My journey crossed the land of standard split keyboards (the Kinesis Freestyle 2), I gazed upon the territory of custom builds, and then I landed on the moon 🌕

In this journey, I felt a sensible improvement in my position, in my breath, on my wrists. Also, a split keyboard is a fancy ice-breaker!

👉 I strongly suggest you to consider trying split keyboards. Start with basic models. Feel yourself. Then proceed with in your journey. I'm sure they'll be for you an unforgettable experience, as they still are for me 😉

I'll tell you more about the moon in the next post... Type tuned!
